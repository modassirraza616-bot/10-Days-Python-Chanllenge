# Given an integer array arr[] and an integer k, your task is to find and return
# the k
# th smallest element in the given array.
# Note: The kth smallest element is determined based on the sorted order of the
# array.
# Examples :
# Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 4, 3, 48, 6, 2, 33, 53, 10], k = 4
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 4th smallest element in the given array is 5

# Method1:
def kthSmallest(arr, k):
    arr.sort()
    return arr[k - 1]

# Example
arr = [10, 5, 4, 3, 48, 6, 2, 33, 53, 10]
k = 4
print(kthSmallest(arr, k))
