# Given an array arr, rotate the array by one position in clockwise direction.
# Examples:
# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and
# remaining those are shifted to the end.

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

last = arr.pop()      # removes and returns last element
arr.insert(0, last)   # inserts at index 0

print(arr)
